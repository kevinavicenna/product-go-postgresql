# **CRUD PostgreSQL using Golang, GoFiber and GORM**

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using **Golang**, **GORM** (an ORM for Go), and **PostgreSQL**. It includes a RESTful API built with **Fiber**, a fast and lightweight web framework for Go.

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinavicenna/product-go-postgresql.git
   cd product-go-postgresql
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the PostgreSQL connection details:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=
   DB_USER=
   DB_PASSWORD=
   DB_NAME=
   DB_PORT=
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Go packages:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Start the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

5. **Access the Application**  
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.  
   - Alternatively, use **Postman** to interact with the API.

## **Why Include `.env`?**

The `.env` file is included in this project for **learning purposes only**. It contains environment variables like database credentials. However, in a production environment, **never include `.env` files** in your repository for security reasons. Use environment management tools like **Docker secrets**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, or **GitHub Secrets** instead.
